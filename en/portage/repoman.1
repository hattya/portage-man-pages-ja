.TH "REPOMAN" "1" "June 2012" "Portage 2.1.10.65" "Portage"
.SH NAME
repoman \- Gentoo's program to enforce a minimal level of quality assurance in packages added to the portage tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrepoman\fR [\fIoption\fR] [\fImode\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR "Quality is job zero."

.BR repoman
checks the quality of ebuild repositories.

Note: \fBrepoman commit\fR only works \fIinside local\fR cvs, git, or subversion repositories.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fB--ask\fR
Request a confirmation before commiting
.TP
\fB\-\-digest=<y|n>\fR
Automatically update Manifest digests for modified files. This
option triggers a behavior that is very similar to that enabled
by FEATURES="digest" in \fBmake.conf\fR(5). In order to enable
this behavior by default for repoman alone, add
\fB\-\-digest=y\fR to the \fIREPOMAN_DEFAULT_OPTS\fR variable in
\fBmake.conf\fR(5). The \fBmanifest\-check\fR mode will
automatically ignore the \-\-digest option.

\fBNOTE:\fR
This option does not trigger update of digests for Manifest DIST
entries that already exist. Replacement of existing Manifest
DIST entries can be forced by using the \fBmanifest\fR mode
together with the \fB\-\-force\fR option.
.TP
\fB--force\fR
Force commit to proceed, regardless of QA issues. For convenience, this option
causes the most time consuming QA checks to be skipped. The commit message will
include an indication that this option has been enabled, together with the
usual portage version stamp.

When used together with \fBmanifest\fR mode, \fB--force\fR causes existing
digests to be replaced for any files that exist in ${DISTDIR}.
Existing digests are assumed to be correct for files that would otherwise
have to be downloaded in order to recompute digests. \fBWARNING:\fR When
replacing existing digests, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that
files contained in ${DISTDIR} have the correct identities. Especially beware
of partially downloaded files.
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Be less verbose about extraneous info
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--pretend\fR
Don't commit or fix anything; just show what would be done
.TP
\fB-x\fR, \fB--xmlparse\fR
Forces the metadata.xml parse check to be carried out
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Displays every package name while checking
.TP
\fB\-\-echangelog=<y|n|force>\fR
For commit mode, call echangelog if ChangeLog is unmodified (or
regardless of modification if 'force' is specified). This option
can be enabled by default for a particular repository by setting
"update\-changelog = true" in metadata/layout.conf (see
\fBportage(5)\fR).
.TP
\fB\-\-if\-modified=<y|n>\fR
Only check packages that have uncommitted modifications
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-arches\fR
Ignore arch-specific failures (where arch != host)
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-default\-opts\fR
Do not use the \fIREPOMAN_DEFAULT_OPTS\fR environment variable.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-masked\fR
Ignore masked packages (not allowed with commit mode)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-include\-dev\fR
Include dev profiles in dependency checks.
.TP
\fB\-\-unmatched\-removal\fR
Enable strict checking of package.mask and package.unmask files for
unmatched removal atoms.
.TP
\fB\-\-without\-mask\fR
Behave as if no package.mask entries exist (not allowed with commit mode)
.TP
\fB-m\fR, \fB--commitmsg\fR
Adds a commit message via the command line
.TP
